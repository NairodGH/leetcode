## 🔍 About

This is my personal python 3 repository where I store my answers to [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) problems in *leetcode.py*.\
As for now it contains in order the problems of my progression in [neetcode's roadmap](https://neetcode.io/roadmap), which I found really well done as it provides a clear topic/difficulty order to follow along with video solutions and even local access to problems I could only do with leetcode premium.\
I started it as soon as I discovered leetcode through [neetcode's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wysIxzqgPI), I love to rack my brains on algorithmic problems as I've been mainly doing in C/C++ since the start of my school cursus and this site gives me the opportunity to do exactly that in a defined manner.\
I chose to code in python 3 because I like the language and I haven't used it much overall, it also helps me focus more on the algorithm rather than on the language itself since it is high level.\
I try to do solve 1 problem regularly to keep a commit pace but I won't force myself in times where my mind's on something else.

## 💻 Requirements

[Python 3](https://www.python.org/)

## 🔧 Building

```
py .\leetcode.py
```

## 🎮 Usage

*leetcode.py* is more of a repository than an actual project file but when I'd want to locally test a function I'd add
```
print(Solution().*function name*(*function parameters*))
```
at the end and run it.
